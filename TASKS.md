- [ ] Add role-based access control (admin vs user)

**Files to create/modify:**
- `services/auth_service.py` - new file

- Create new monitoring service

### 5. Volume Management & Persistent Storage
**Status:** TODO Marked in Code  
**Estimated Time:** 1 week  
**Description:** Improve file storage and volume mounting
- [ ] Complete TODO in `routes/server_routes.py:76` for B2 volume mounting
- [ ] Implement direct volume mounts instead of backup/restore cycle
- [ ] Add real-time file synchronization between pods and B2
- [ ] Support for larger world files and plugins
- [ ] Add storage usage tracking and limits

**Files to modify:**
- `routes/server_routes.py` - lines 76, 136
- `services/b2_storage_service.py` - add volume mounting
- `utils/kubernetes_deployment_builder.py` - add volume configurations

### 6. API Documentation
**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days  
**Description:** Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- [ ] Create interactive API documentation
- [ ] Add code examples for all endpoints
- [ ] Document authentication requirements
- [ ] Create SDK/client library examples

**Files to create:**
- `docs/api-spec.yaml` - OpenAPI specification
- `docs/examples/` - code examples directory

## 🟢 **Low Priority (Future Enhancements)**

### 7. Multiple Game Support
**Status:** Planned  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks  
**Description:** Extend beyond Minecraft
- [ ] Add game type detection and configuration
- [ ] Create game-specific deployment templates
- [ ] Add support for popular games (Valheim, Terraria, etc.)
- [ ] Dynamic port and resource allocation per game type
- [ ] Game-specific backup and restore logic

### 8. Cost Management & Billing
**Status:** Planned  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 weeks  
**Description:** Add usage tracking and cost controls
